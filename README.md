Hello I'm Justa, welcomo to my profile! 👋

Digital arts lover, full time dreamer. I'm a fullstack web dev, amateur artist and cinema lover based in Porto.
I love to think outside the box and find creative solutions for all my projects. I also really like to make 
digital illustrations, especially I like to create [my own Pokémon](https://www.instagram.com/stellaregion/). 

I wish to learn more about 
web development and UI/UX so i can become even better.
